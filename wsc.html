        <h1>Hello Scholars!</h1>
        <p class="mono">It's been a while since I made a site but I'm sure it won't turn out terrible,Oh well, here I go...</p><br>
        <p class="intro">Welcome world scholars of Kabarak.Let's start with an intro to the competition that brought you here, The World Scholar's Cup.The cup is a competition that brings scholars from all around the world to rounds to compete in 4 different events:</p>
        <dl class="list1">
            <dt>Team Debate</dt>
            <dd>Three debates against other teams with 'unique' motions like "All people should wear shoes that make them the same height" and "World leaders should be chosen by an Artificial Intelligence."</dd>
            <dt>Collaborative Writing</dt>
            <dd>One topic from each subject and 1hr to write 3 essays with your teammates, You can write a play, a story, a dialogue or whatever you want. It's a rush against time and we usually waste time drawing an alpaca on our scripts.</dd>
            <dt>The Scholar's Challenge</dt>
            <dd>The Scholar's Challange is WSC staff's name for the 1hr of hell scholars go through every round. 120 multiple choice questions, 20 from every subject and absolutely no chance of answering every question unless you're guessing.</dd>
            <dt>The Scholars' Bowl</dt>
            <dd>Probably the most fun event of the cup. One clicker per team and several questions awarded marks according to the mood of WSC staff. It's a great bonding experience for your team as you argue over which answer to choose.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p class="main">There's three rounds: The Regional Round, The Global Round and The Tournament of Champions. To prepare for each round you should be well-versed with the WSC syllabus which can be found on <a href="https://www.scholarscup.org/subjects/">WSC's official site</a>. On a team of three, each member should specialize on two subjects and have a rudimentary grasp of the other four. The subject topics change per year but as of 2022 we're still using the 2020 syllabus due to the stall in WSC events caused by COVID-19.the topics are:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Science & Technology</dt>
            <dd>To Edit a Planet</dd>
            <dt>Social Studies</dt>
            <dd>Out With the Old</dd>
            <dt>History</dt>
            <dd>The History of Succession</dd>
            <dt>Art & Music</dt>
            <dd>Second Chances, Second Glances</dd>
            <dt>Literature & Media</dt>
            <dd>Reboots,Sequels and Reconsiderations</dd>
            <dt>Special Area</dt>
            <dd>Mistakes & Recoveries</dd>
        </dl>
        <p class="outro">Now scholars, the main reason I decided to code this webpage. Meeting after Meeting we usually ask you guys to print the syllabus and usually you don't.Let's be honest the ones we got last time were really crappy, giving us questions which we couldn't really research on. Due to the restricted interactions with electronics at school I've compiled an already researched syllabus into a printable format. I got them from a site which is a personal favourite of mine when preparing for WSC; <a href="https://avansalpacaresources.weebly.com/">Avans Alpaca Resources</a>(Check out their debate guides and quizzes too, they really help when it comes to team debates and the scholar's challenge.) </p>

                <p>Well this didn't turn out as bad as I thought,I might expand it later. Good luck in the cup, you'll come a lot of challenges but never give in and keep pushing foward. In the words of the Scout Regiment's best commander; Erwin Smith</p><br>
                <q class="q">My soldiers do not buckle when faced with overwhelming odds, my soldiers push foward, MY SOLDIERS SCREAM OUT! MY SOLDIERS RAGE!</q>
